# Working_With_JSON-SQL

This repository contains sample work related to **JSON and SQL**, including training JSON files and a Jupyter Notebook demo.

## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates how to work with JSON data (stored in `train.json`) and interact with it in a SQL-like environment or tools. It also includes a sample notebook (`test.ipynb`) showing basic exploration or experiments with this data.

> A README should tell what your project does, why it’s useful, and how others can get started. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
